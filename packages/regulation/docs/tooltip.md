# Popup/tooltip

## Challenges

A click on a feature (a gene or a regulatory feature) should show a popup with the description of this feature.

The challenge is that the content of the tooltip can be different depending on whether the component is used standalone or it is integrated in a particular site (e.g. the new Ensembl site). For example, on the new Ensembl site, it may include navigation buttons taking the user to a different page of the site, which will be irrelevant when the component is used outside of the Ensembl site.
